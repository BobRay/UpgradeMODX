Once the package is installed, you should see the widget in the default dashboard. When an upgrade is available, you will see an Upgrade MODX button in the widget. To upgrade your site, just click on it (but back up the site first). For details on configuring UpgradeMODX, see the documentation link above.

Always back up your files and database tables before upgrading.

This package was inspired by the work of a number of people and I have borrowed some of their code. Dmytro Lukianenko (dmi3yy) is the original author of the MODX install script. Susan Sottwell, Sharapov, Bumkaka, Inreti, Zaigham Rana, frischnetz, and AgelxNash, also contributed and I'd like to thank all of them for laying the groundwork.
