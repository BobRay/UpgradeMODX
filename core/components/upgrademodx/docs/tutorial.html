<p>UpgradeMODX provides a dashboard widget that checks for available upgrades to MODX and (optionally) installs them.
    The upgrade process is automatic and very simple. It shows you a form with available versions to install (you can
    set how many it shows). Once you've selected one, UpgradeMODX downloads all the files, puts them in place, and
    launches Setup. It should upgrade *any* version of MODX except the SDK development version. It should correctly
    upgrade versions with a moved and/or renamed manager, core, connectors, assets, or processors directory. I think it
    will upgrade the SDK version to the non-SDK version, but I haven't tested that.</p>

<p>Upgrade MODX is only for upgrades. It will not install a fresh MODX site.</p>

<br/>

<p><b>No matter what upgrade method you use, you are strongly advised to make a full backup of the database and all
    files and be prepared to restore the site if things go wrong.</b></p>

<h3>New System Setting</h3>

<p>MODX 3 versions will not be shown in the list on sites running MODX 2.x  unless you change the <code>ugm_show_modx3</code> System Setting. There are still extras that will not work in MODX 3, so please don't upgrade a production website to MODX 3 unless you've made sure that any extras you need <a href="https://sitedash.app/extras" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">will work on that platform</a> and <a href="https://docs.modx.com/3.x/en/getting-started/upgrading-to-3.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">understand the risks and requirements</a> involved in the upgrade. For more information, see the MODX 3 Notes section below.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p>If the UpgradeMODX widget doesn't show up on the dashboard, make sure you are a member of the Administrator group. (You're not by default if you're logged in as an admin user created on the MODX Cloud dashboard.) Add yourself to the Administrator group, clear the cache, go to Manage -> Flush Your Permissions, then log out and back in again.</p>

      <p>If you want Manager users to see the dashboard without belonging to the Administrator group, change the <code>ugm_groups</code> System Setting. </p>
</div>


<p>For testing purposes (and to fix possible corrupted or missing MODX files), you can &quot;upgrade&quot; MODX to the
    version you currently have by changing the <code>settings_version</code> System Setting to an earlier version.
    UpgradeMODX will go through all of its steps, download and replace all the MODX files, and launch setup. In theory,
    UpgradeMODX can also be used to &quot;downgrade&quot; MODX to a previous version, though this has not been
    extensively tested.</p>

<br/>
<div class="box">
    <p>If you have moved or renamed any directories. UpgradeMODX should work fine. It calculates the correct location
        for the files by reading the <code>config.inc.php</code> file. Setup should no longer ask you where your core
        directory is.</p>
</div>

<br/>
<h3>Installing UpgradeMODX</h3>

<p>Go to Extras -> Installer (or System -> Package Management in older versions of MODX) on the main menu in the MODX
    Manager and click on the &quot;Download Extras&quot; button. That will take you to the Revolution Repository. Put UpgradeMODX in the search box and press Enter. Click on the &quot;Download&quot;
    button, and once the package is downloaded, click on the &quot;Back to Package Manager&quot; button. That should
    bring you back to your Package Management grid. Click on the &quot;Install&quot; button next to UpgradeMODX in the
    grid. The UpgradeMODX package should now be installed.</p>

<br/>
<div class="box">
    <h3>Upgrade Notes</h3>
    <p>Version 2.3.x of UpgradeMODX is fully tested in MODX 3. It can be used to upgrade from MODX 2.8.x to MODX 3.x.x. It stores configuration data in System Settings, so all settings will survive upgrades. The Settings can be found by going to System (gear icon) -> System Settings and selecting the <code>upgrademodx</code> namespace.</p>

    <p>Here's a quick summary showing some of the changes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Extensive mods for MODX 3.</li>
        <li>Fixes a critical security vulnerability in the guzzlehttp/psr7 library</li>
        <li>More reliable connection of widget to default dashboard</li>
        <li>Improved docs</li>
        <li>Other bug fixes and improvements</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Because Guzzle is used for the HTTP requests, PHP 5.4 is now the minimum required version of PHP, though some
        users have reported that they needed to upgrade to PHP 7 to get UpgradeMODX to work for them.</p>
</div>

<h3>Credits</h3>
<p>This package was inspired by the work of a number of people and I have borrowed some of their code. Dmytro Lukianenko
    (dmi3yy) is the original author of the MODX install script. Susan Sottwell, Sharapov, Bumkaka, Inreti, Zaigham Rana,
    frischnetz, AgelxNash, and halftrainedharry, also contributed and I'd like to thank all of them for laying the groundwork and helping improve the code.</p>

<br/>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>To upgrade your site, just select a version to upgrade to and click on the &quot;Upgrade MODX&quot; button in
    the widget. UpgradeMODX will select the recommended version automatically. Downloading and extracting the files may take some time, so be patient.</p>

<p>Once you've installed UpgradeMODX, the widget should appear. It's attached to the default dashboard, so if you have another dashboard showing, you'll have to attach it to that dashboard by going to System (gear icon) -> Dashboards.</p>

<br/>

<h3>MODX 3 Notes</h3>

<p>MODX Revolution 3 is a significantly different from MODX Revolution 2. While UpgradeMODX will upgrade you from one to the next, you need to keep a couple of things in mind.</p>

<p>First, you should always upgrade to MODX 3.0.0-pl before upgrading to higher versions. If you are coming from an older version of MODX 2, install all the versions ending in .0 and then the highest version before 3.0.0 before installing 3.0.0.</p>

<p>Second, after you upgrade, you need to clear the MODX cache (I recommend doing it with the CacheClear extra, which works fine in MODX 3), and also your browser cache and cookies. Left over stuff in the cache and cookies can make a mess of the MODX Manager. I use the Cache Killer Chrome extension, but Incognito or Private mode will work as well. Once Cache Killer is installed, one click on the toolbar turns off the cache for both web pages and cookies. Another click turns it back on.</p>

<p>Before upgrading to MODX 3, you'll also want to make sure the extras you need work in MODX 3. There's a MODX 3 compatibility list <a href="https://sitedash.app/extras" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. There may be extras not listed as compatible there that will work in MODX 3 but haven't been tested yet. If you try one be sure to report whether it works or not on that page.</p>

<br/>

<div class="box">
    <p>In very old versions of MODX, creation of the dashboard widget will fail and you'll see a bunch of error messages
        during the install. The UpgradeMODX installer will attempt to create a resource called <code>UpgradeMODX</code>
        that will show the install check. If no widget appears, view the resource to check for MODX upgrades. When an
        upgrade is available, it should let you launch the installer.</p>

    <p>If the snippet and chunks fail to install (this is fairly rare), your version of PHP is too new for your MODX
        install and you'll have trouble saving chunks and snippets in the Manager as well. You can either downgrade the
        version of PHP , or manually make the changes to the three files shown in <a
                href="https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/pull/11128/files">this commit</a>. </p>

    <p>Once you've upgraded MODX to a recent-enough version, you can uninstall and re-install UpgradeMODX to get the
        widget. You can also upgrade to the current version of PHP.</p>
</div>


<br/>


<p>As installed, the widget will only appear for members of the Administrator group. To show it to other groups, change
    the <code>ugm_groups</code> System Setting to a comma-separated list of groups who can see the widget.  You can also change the <code>ugm_interval</code> System Setting if
    you'd like it to check for upgrades more, or less often, though the default value is now 1 day.</p>

<p>Hint: To get to the Manager's dashboard, you can click on the MODX logo at the upper left.</p>

<p>Note that if you set the interval to 60 seconds (as it is in the beta and rc versions), it won't execute every 60
    seconds. It will only execute when you visit the dashboard at least 60 seconds after the last check. The minimum
    recommendation for the <code>ugm_interval</code> System Setting on a production site is <code>1 hour</code>.</p>

<p>By default, UpgradeMODX considers only pl (stable) versions for upgrade (except in the beta and rc versions). You can
    change the <code>ugm_pl_only</code> System Setting to see all versions. You can change the <code>ugm_versions_to_show</code>
    System Setting to show more versions (the default is 5). UpgradeMODX will automatically extend the versions shown to
    include your current version. Initially, the interval for checking is set to <code>1 day</code> (except in the beta
    and rc versions where it's 60 seconds). You can change that by setting the <code>ugm_interval</code> System Setting.
    That setting should always be an integer followed by the name of the unit (e.g., 6 hours, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month.
</p>

<p>If you would like to hide the widget when no upgrade is available, change the <code>ugm_hide_when_no_upgrade</code>
    System Setting. The widget will still check for upgrades at the selected interval, but won't appear in the
    dashboard(s) unless an upgrade exists.</p>

<p>If you would like to fool the widget into thinking there is an upgrade, you can change the
    <code>settings_version</code> System Setting. Make it any earlier version (it doesn't have to be a real version) and
    the widget will show an update. If you install the update (even though it's not an update) and finish Setup, it will
    restore the System Setting to its correct value. If you don't run an upgrade, be sure to change the System Setting
    back to its original value.</p>

<p>You can set the language used by the widget with the <code>ugm_language</code> System Setting</p>

<p>You are *strongly* advised not to change anything in the package except the System Settings.</p>

<br/>
<h3>Security</h3>

<p>The upgrade processors can only be run from the Manager, and only by users who belong to allowed user groups
    (Administrator by default). Even if the processors were available to the public, all they would do is upgrade your
    site.</p>

<p>The upgrade script downloads everything to the <code>/ugmtemp</code> directory in the MODX root directory (or another
    directory if you have set the <code>ugm_temp_dir</code> System Setting). At the default location, UpgradeMODX
    deletes that directory when it finishes successfully so nothing should be left behind after the upgrade.</p>

<p>If you have changed the directory, UpgradeMODX will leave the downloaded <code>.zip</code> files in place. This is
    handy if you have multiple MODX installs on the same server and avoid downloading the <code>.zip</code> file for
    each one.</p>

<p>After upgrading the site, It's a good idea to make sure that the <code>/ugmtemp</code> directory has been removed,
    especially if the script times out or fails. The files are relatively harmless, but their existence could identify
    your site as a MODX site, and there's no point in giving potential hackers that information.</p>

<br/>
<h3>GitHub API Rate Limit Exceeded</h3>
<br/>

<p>The default install of UpgradeMODX makes anonymous requests to the MODX repository at GitHub for information.
    Requests of this type are limited to 60 per hour. If a lot of people are making requests, or your
    <code>ugm_interval</code> setting is very short, or if you are doing a lot of testing, this limit could be hit and
    you will either get the error message: <code>GitHub API Rate Limit Exceeded</code> or the script will report that it
    couldn't get the version list from GitHub. You can try again later, but to solve this problem permanently, you can
    get your own GitHub token so your requests will not be anonymous. That will bump your limit up to 5,000 requests per
    hour.</p>

<p>You can create a free account at GitHub, or use an existing one. To get a token, follow the directions <a
        href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/" target="_blank">here</a>.
    Copy your token to the clipboard, then paste it into the <code>ugm_github_token</code> System Setting. Enter your
    GitHub username in the <code>ugm_github_username</code> System Setting. Don't forget to clear the cache after
    changing any settings. Some browsers will cache the request headers, which contain the credentials, so you may also
    need to clear your browser cache and cookies.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Multiple Installs</h3>

<p>If you have multiple MODX sites on the same server, you can set the <code>ugm_temp_dir</code> System Setting to a
    path that's available to all sites, like your server's tmp directory. Once you do that, UpgradeMODX will leave the
    downloaded .zip file in place and skip the download for all sites but the first one. Remember to change that setting
    on all the sites before performing any upgrades.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>If UpgradeMODX reports trouble getting the versions from GitHub, you should get a helpful error message. If you'd
    like to see the full message returned from GitHub, set the <code>ugm_verbose</code> System Setting to
    <code>Yes</code>.</p>
<br>
<div class="box">
    <p>If you get persistent errors about the versionlist, you can bypass them by following the
        steps below. Before you do that, though, try turning off the MODX News and Security Feeds. Go to System
        (gear->icon) -> System Settings and put <code>feed</code> in the search box at the upper right.</p>

    <p>It might also be wise to move the UpgradeMODX widget above the Feed widgets in your dashboard by giving it a
        lower rank in System -> Dashboards. Right-click on your dashboard and select &quot;Update Dashboard.&quot;
        Change the ranks and click on the &quot;Save&quot; button.</p>

    <p>If none of that works, create the file: core/cache/upgrademodx/versionlist then follow these steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Go to this url: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;
  word-wrap: break-word;" href="//api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/tags">//api.github.com/repos/modxcms/revolution/tags</a>.
        </li>

        <li>Copy the <b>entire</b> contents of your browser window (Ctrl-a, Ctrl-c)</li>

        <li>Paste it into the file (Ctrl-v).</li>

        <li>Note the name of the latest version at the top of the file (e.g., 2.7.0-pl)</li>

        <li>Set the <code>ugm_last_check</code> and <code>ugm_file_version</code> settings to the latest version</li>

        <li>Clear the Site Cache in the Manager</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You should be able to do as many upgrades as needed in the next 24 hours</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>If you get frequent timeouts, you can increase the <code>ugm_github_timeout</code> or <code>ugm_modx_timeout</code>
    System Settings. They set how long the program will wait for a response. The default is 6 seconds.</p>

<p>UpgradeMODX now uses Guzzle (which uses cURL by default) to check for and download files. If cURL isn't installed on
    your server, Guzzle uses streams to get remote files and requires PHP 5.4 to work.</p>

<p>UpgradeMODX uses ZipArchive to unzip the files. You can set the <code>ugm_force_pcl_zip</code> SystemSetting to
    <code>Yes</code> to avoid using ZipArchive to unzip the downloaded MODX file. </p>

<br/>

<div class="box">
    <p>As of Version 2.0.0 of UpgradeMODX the cURL SSL_VERIFY_PEER option to is set to <code>true</code> by default in Guzzle. Guzzle uses the server's certificate file, so there should be no need to turn it off. Having this
        setting off leaves you vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks where the attacker could pretend to be the MODX
        repo and lead you to download malicious code instead of MODX. If you can't get UpgradeMODX to work because of
        SSL issues, the best solution is to check with your host. There is a information <a
                href="http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/request-options.html#verify">here</a> on the verification process.</p>

    <p>Turning the <code>ugm_ssl_verify_peer</code> System Setting off might make it work for you, but in a less secure
        way.

    <p>UGM has a <code>ugm_cert_path</code> System Setting (empty by default). If you are having SSL trouble,
        you could try asking the host or checking their forum for the path to the SSL cert file. Paste that path into
        the <code>value</code> field of this setting.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>If UpgradeMODX shows an available upgrade but the submit button doesn't work, check the spelling of the <code>assets/components/upgrademodx/js/progressButton.js</code>
    file. Make sure the "B" matches the case of the filename in the UpgradeMODXTpl chunk.</p>

<p>Note that some browsers cache the credentials used in HTTP requests. If you change the
    <code>ugm_github_username</code> and <code>ugm_github_token</code> settings. They may not take effect until you
    clear the browser cache (and maybe the cookies) or use a different browser that doesn't have the cached credentials.
</p>

<p>If the widget doesn't appear. Go to System (gear icon) -> Dashboards and check to make sure the widget is on the
    default dashboard (or whatever dashboard you're using).</p>

<h3>Catch 22</h3>

<p>There is a bug in very old versions of MODX that prevents some elements of UpgradeMODX and other extras from being
    installed if you are using PHP 7 (see the note above about fixing this bug manually). At the same time, UpgradeMODX
    now requires PHP 5.4 or above because that's what Guzzle requires. There may be other incompatibilities in older
    versions of MODX and some of your plugins might interfere with the setup process.</p>

<p>If UpgradeMODX fails for you and the troubleshooting steps above don't work, the best approach is to use PHP 5.4, and
    upgrade MODX manually using the method described <a href="https://bobsguides.com/modx-upgrade-faq.html">here</a>.
    Make sure you install all major versions of MODX (the ones ending in .0).</p>

<p>Once you hit MODX 2.4, you should be able to upgrade to PHP 7 (assuming that you've fixed the bug), then uninstall
    and remove Upgrade MODX, re-install it, and use UpgradeMODX from that point on. For security, and to prevent future
    hassles, keep your MODX install up to date.</p>
