<p>UpgradeMODX provides a dashboard widget that checks for available upgrades to MODX and (optionally) installs them. The upgrade process is automatic and very simple. It shows you a form with available versions to install (you can set how many it shows). Once you've selected one, UpgradeMODX downloads all the files, puts them in place, and launches Setup. It should upgrade *any* version of MODX except the SDK development version. It should correctly upgrade versions with a moved and/or renamed manager, core, connectors, assets, or processors directory. I think it will upgrade the SDK version to the non-SDK version, but I haven't tested that.</p>

<p>Upgrade MODX is only for upgrades. It will not install a fresh MODX site.</p>

<br />

<p><b>No matter what upgrade method you use, you are strongly advised to make a full backup of the database and all files and be prepared to restore the site if things go wrong.</b></p>


<p>For testing purposes (and to fix possible corrupted or missing MODX files), you can &quot;upgrade&quot; MODX to the version you currently have by changing the <code>settings_version</code> System Setting to an earlier version.  UpgradeMODX will go through all of its steps, download and replace all the MODX files, and launch setup. In theory, UpgradeMODX can also be used to &quot;downgrade&quot; MODX to a previous version, though this has not been extensively tested.</p>

<br />
<div class="box">
    <p>If you have moved or renamed any directories. UpgradeMODX should work fine. It calculates the correct location for the files by reading the <code>config.inc.php</code> file. Setup should no longer ask you where your core directory is.</p>
</div>

<br />
<h3>Installing UpgradeMODX</h3>

<p>Go to Extras -> Installer (or System -> Package Management in older versions of MODX) on the main menu in the MODX Manager and click on the &quot;Download Extras&quot; button. That will take you to the Revolution Repository (AKA Web Transport Facility). Put UpgradeMODX in the search box and press Enter. Click on the &quot;Download&quot; button, and once the package is downloaded, click on the &quot;Back to Package Manager&quot; button. That should bring you back to your Package Management grid. Click on the &quot;Install&quot; button next to UpgradeMODX in the grid. The UpgradeMODX package should now be installed.</p>

    <h3>Upgrade Notes</h3>
    <p>Version 2.2.0 of UpgradeMODX has a very different look and many upgrades. It stores all configuration data in System Settings instead of snippet properties, so all settings will survive upgrades. The Settings can be found by going to System (gear icon) -> System Settings and selecting the <code>upgrademodx</code> namespace. The installation script will attempt to copy your snippet property values to the new System Settings. In view of the attacks on MODX, the default <code>interval</code> will be reset to 1 Day.</p>

    <p>Most of the work is now done in JavaScript and MODX processors. The UpgradeMODXScriptSource chunk has been removed.</p>

    <p>Here's a quick summary showing some of the new features:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Tell Setup where the core is, so it doesn't ask!</li>
        <li>Restyle for Mobile</li>
        <li>Automatically select appropriate upgrade version</li>
        <li>Automatically extend version list to include current version</li>
        <li>Indicate current version in version list</li>
        <li>Report progress during upgrade process</li>
        <li>3D animation for progress (except on f@$@|#% IE < Edge)</li>
        <li>Use a separate processor for each step to avoid PHP timeouts</li>
        <li>Use Guzzle for all remote file and data access</li>
        <li>Operate entirely in the Manager until setup is launched</li>
        <li>Fix bug with missing versionlist error</li>
        <li>Make sure downloaded file is closed</li>
        <li>Get MODX files directly from AWS</li>
        <li>Other bug fixes and improvements</li>

    </ul>

<h3>Credits</h3>
<p>This package was inspired by the work of a number of people and I have borrowed some of their code. Dmytro Lukianenko (dmi3yy) is the original author of the MODX install script. Susan Sottwell, Sharapov, Bumkaka, Inreti, Zaigham Rana, frischnetz, and AgelxNash, also contributed and I'd like to thank all of them for laying the groundwork.</p>

<br/>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>To upgrade your site, just click select a version to upgrade to and click on the &quot;Upgrade MODX&quot; button in the widget. Downloading and extracting the files may take some time, so be patient.</p>

<p>Once you've installed UpgradeMODX, the widget should appear. It's attached to the default dashboard, so if you have another dashboard showing, you'll have to attach it to that dashboard by going to System (gear icon) -> Dashboards.</p>

<br />

<div class="box">
    <p>In very old versions of MODX, creation of the dashboard widget will fail and you'll see a bunch of error messages during the install. The UpgradeMODX installer will attempt to create a resource  called <code>UpgradeMODX</code> that will show the install check. If no widget appears, view the resource to check for MODX upgrades. When an upgrade is available, it will let you launch the installer.</p>

<p>If the snippet and chunks fail to install (this if fairly rare), your version of PHP is too new for your MODX install and you'll have trouble saving chunks and snippets in the Manager as well. You can either downgrade the version of PHP to version 5.4 or below, or manually make the changes to the three files shown in <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/pull/11128/files">this commit</a>. </p>

<p>Once you've upgraded MODX to a recent-enough version, you can uninstall and re-install UpgradeMODX to get the widget. You can also upgrade to the current version of PHP.</p>
</div>


<br/>


<p>As installed, the widget will only appear for members of the Administrator group. To show it to other groups, change the <code>ugm_groups</code> System Setting. You can also change the <code>ugm_interval</code> System Setting if you'd like it to check for upgrades more, or less often, though the default value is now 1 day.</p>

<p>Hint: To get to the Manager's dashboard, you can click on the MODX logo at the upper left.</p>

<p>Note that if you set the interval to 60 seconds (as it is in the beta and rc versions), it won't execute every 60 seconds. It will only execute when you visit the dashboard at least 60 seconds after the last check. The minimum recommendation for the <code>ugm_interval</code> System Setting on a production site is <code>1 hour</code>.</p>

<p>By default, UpgradeMODX considers only pl (stable) versions for upgrade (except in the beta and rc versions). You can change the <code>ugm_pl_only</code> System Setting to see all versions. You can change the <code>ugm_versions_to_show</code> System Setting to show more versions (the default is 5). UpgradeMODX will automatically extend the versions shown to include your current version. Initially, the interval for checking is set to <code>1 day</code> (except in the beta and rc versions where it's 60 seconds). You can change that by setting the <code>ugm_interval</code> System Setting. That setting should always be an integer followed by the name of the unit (e.g., 6 hours, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month.</p>

<p>If you would like to hide the widget when no upgrade is available, change the <code>ugm_hide_when_no_upgrade</code> System Setting. The widget will still check for upgrades at the selected interval, but won't appear in the dashboard(s) unless an upgrade exists.</p>

<p>If you would like to fool the widget into thinking there is an upgrade, you can change the <code>settings_version</code> System Setting. Make it any earlier version (it doesn't have to be a real version) and the widget will show an update. If you install the update (even though it's not an update) and finish Setup, it will restore the System Setting to its correct value. If you don't run an upgrade, be sure to change the System Setting back to its original value.</p>

<p>You can set the language used by the widget with the <code>ugm_language</code> System Setting</p>

<p>You are *strongly* advised not to change anything in the package except the System Settings.</p>

<br/>
<h3>Security</h3>

<p>The upgrade processors can only be run from the Manager, and only by users who belong to allowed user groups (Administrator by default). The Even if the processors were available to the public, all they would do is upgrade your site.</p>

<p>The upgrade script downloads everything to the <code>/ugmtemp</code> directory in the MODX root directory (or another directory if you have set the <code>ugm_temp_dir</code> System Setting). UpgradeMODX deletes that directory when it finishes successfully so nothing should be left behind after the upgrade.</p>

<p>After upgrading the site, It's a good idea to make sure that the <code>/ugmtemp</code> directory has been removed, especially if the script times out or fails. The files are relatively harmless, but their existence could identify your site as a MODX site, and there's no point in giving potential hackers that information.</p>

<br />
<h3>GitHub API Rate Limit Exceeded</h3>
<br />

<p>The default install of UpgradeMODX makes anonymous requests to the MODX repository at GitHub for information. Requests of this type are limited to 60 per hour. If a lot of people are making requests, or your <code>ugm_interval</code> setting is very short, or if you are doing a lot of testing, this limit could be hit and you will either get the error message: <code>GitHub API Rate Limit Exceeded</code> or the script will report that it couldn't get the version list from GitHub. You can try again later, but to solve this problem permanently, you can get your own GitHub token so your requests will not be anonymous. That will bump your limit up to 5,000 requests per hour.</p>

<p>You can create a free account at GitHub, or use an existing one. To get a token, follow the directions <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/" target="_blank">here</a>. Copy your token to the clipboard, then paste it into the <code>ugm_github_token</code> System Setting. Enter your GitHub username in the <code>ugm_github_username</code> System Setting. Don't forget to clear the cache after changing any settings.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>If you get frequent timeouts, you can increase the <code>ugm_github_timeout</code> or <code>ugm_modx_timeout</code> System Settings. They set how long the program will wait for a response. The default is 6 seconds.</p>

<p>UpgradeMODX now uses Guzzle (which uses cURL by default) to check for and download files. It uses ZipArchive to unzip them. If cURL isn't installed, Guzzle uses streams to get remote files. You can set the <code>ugm_force_pcl_zip</code> SystemSetting to <code>Yes</code> to avoid using ZipArchive to unzip the downloaded MODX file. </p>

<br />

<div class="box">
    <p>In Version 2.0.0 of UpgradeMODX the cURL SSL_VERIFY_PEER option to is set to <code>true</code> by default in Guzzle. Guzzle uses the servers certificate file, so there should be no need to turn it off. Having this setting off leaves you vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks where the attacker could pretend to be the MODX repo and lead you to download malicious code instead of MODX. If you can't get UpgradeMODX to work because of SSL issues. The best solution is to check with your host, but turning the <code>ugm_ssl_verify_peer</code> System Setting off might make it work for you, but in a less secure way.

    <p>Version 2.0.0 has a new setting: <code>ugm_cert_path</code> (empty by default). If you are having SSL trouble, you could try asking the host or checking their forum for the path to the SSL cert file. Paste that path into the <code>value</code> field of this setting.</p>
